# ProvWorkflow 

This `edg/` folder within the ProvWorkflow version control repository contains the semantic definitional assets of ProvWorkflow (ProvWF). In particular:

* ProvWF Ontology
* ProvWV Profile declaration
* ProvWF SOP Manifest

Both the Profile and the Manifest are schedules of assets of sorts, so look to them (profile.ttl & manifest.ttl respectively) for formal listings of this part of the repository's contents.
